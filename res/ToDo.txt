ToDo:

1. Dynamically resize elements. Fix the MinWidth, MinHeight, MaxWidth and MaxHeight.
2. Add Yaml Validation with the existing SnakeYaml - Validate function (v2.0.0)
3. Add "continue: true" logic
4. Add Dark mode.
5. Add reset button.
6. Handle UI cases when switched between pages before mapping and pertain values.
7. Lookout for better Data model and reduce mapping complexity.
8. Make a UI guide with the layout's widths and heights to alter in future.
9. Add comments.
10. Make use of other factors like repeat_interval. 
11. Add FontAwesome icons to buttons.
12. Design other pages.
13. Add logic for inhibit_rules (But that is tough, since you have to filter and disable.)
14. Finetune regular expressions (v2.0.0)
15. Add cool svgs
16. Remove json parameter from setReceiver and setRoute functions and refactor them.
17. Enable validate and visualize buttons at right times.

19. Add suggestions in validate page.
20. Test with wrong-alertmanager.yaml and catch mistakes (v2.0.0).
21. Add timer to calculate frequency of alert (This is difficult though.)

Done:

1. Rename fx elements variable name as java elements variable name + Fx.
2. Place the functions in correct heirarchy.
3. Indent java files
4. Comment out unnecessary print lines.
5. Refactor to "PARS" (Prometheus Alerts Routing Simulation)
6. Add "+" button and logic to add multiple rule files.
7. Make a lot of input testcases and test with them.
8. Fix the "+" button bug. (Shouldnt increment immediately, idea - disable and enable at appropriate time.)
9. Learn and do the build.
