## Overview

The problem statement is aimed at developing an application to assist developers in debugging code. Method tracing is one of the commonly used post-mortem diagnostic method to identify problems. It consists of timestamp of entry and exit points for each method invocation. They may also contain stack-trace for each invocation. Depending upon the time for which trace data is collected, the file-size for these traces can be huge. Parsing them manually is a time consuming and error-prone task.
